A good visual analysis of terrorist attacks is essential to help (1) discover global terrorism trends, (2) unveil hidden relationships among terrorist networks through their attacks and (3) ascertain the impact of fatalities and losses.\n\nThe team aims to use open-source data which includes information on terrorist events globally to provide easy-to-use and insightful visualisation tools that can be especially suitable for Defence and Security sectors to develop effective counter terrorism measures and strategies.\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe objective of this project is to:\n\n1.  Examine open-source data on terrorist events worldwide (The Global Terrorism Database(GTD)) and derive useful insights on the factors and conditions that may affect international terrorist incidents, and\n2.  Build a web-enabled interactive visual analytics application by using R Shiny based on this Global Terrorism Database (GTD).\n\n# Data\n\nThe project will examine the Global Terrorism Database™ (GTD) from [University of Maryland](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd){target=\"_blank\"} that holds 5 decades (i.e. Year 1970 to Year 2020) of attack events that happened in 203 countries. The original dataset consists of 209,706 observations and 135 variables. Given the large dataset, the team will filter the dataset to eliminate unnecessary data to ensure quality of data used is pertinent to project objective.\n\n# Methodology & Analytical Approach\n\nFor this project, the following approach will be taken by the team:\n\n1.  **Data Preparation:** Clean the dataset by removing irrelevant variables, filtering variables and encoding categorical variables if necessary.\n\n    -   The table below shows the variables that we have selected to maintain.\n\n    -   For detailed description of the variables, please refer to the Code Book in the reference section.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item\"

Methods:** Analyse the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identify patterns, and explore correlation between variables. Such as using:\n\n    a.  Time-series bar/ line chart and bubble plot\n\n    b.
