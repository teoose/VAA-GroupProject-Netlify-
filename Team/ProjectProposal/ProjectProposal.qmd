# Motivation

Terrorism, especially coordinated attacks targeting innocent civilians, have been a constant in our lives, threatening the public both physically and psychologically. A good visual analysis of terrorist attacks is essential to help (1) discover global terrorism trends, (2) unveil hidden relationships among terrorist networks through their attacks and (3) ascertain the impact of fatalities and losses.

The team aims to use open-source data which includes information on terrorist events globally to provide easy-to-use and insightful visualisation tools that can be especially suitable for Defence and Security sectors to develop effective counter terrorism measures and strategies.

# Objectives

The objective of this project is to:

1.  Examine open-source data on terrorist events worldwide (The Global Terrorism Database(GTD)) and derive useful insights on the factors and conditions that may affect international terrorist incidents, and
2.  Build a web-enabled interactive visual analytics application by using R Shiny based on this Global Terrorism Database (GTD).

# Data

The project will examine the Global Terrorism Database™ (GTD) from [University of Maryland](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd){target="_blank"} that holds 5 decades (i.e. Year 1970 to Year 2020) of attack events that happened in 203 countries. The original dataset consists of 209,706 observations and 135 variables. Given the large dataset, the team will filter the dataset to eliminate unnecessary data to ensure quality of data used is pertinent to project objective.

# Methodology & Analytical Approach

For this project, the following approach will be taken by the team:

1.  **Data Preparation:** Clean the dataset by removing irrelevant variables, filtering variables and encoding categorical variables if necessary.

    -   The table below shows the variables that we have selected to maintain.

    -   For detailed description of the variables, please refer to the Code Book in the reference section.

```{r,echo=FALSE}

pacman::p_load(tidyverse,readxl)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

data <- read_excel('data/Summary_variables.xlsx')
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}

DT::datatable(data, class = "compact")
```

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis via Data Visualisation Methods:** Analyse the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identify patterns, and explore correlation between variables. Such as using:

    a.  Time-series bar/ line chart and bubble plot

    b.  Geospatial heatmaps and hotspot maps

3.  **Confirmatory Data Analysis via Statistical Methods:** Analyse the dataset using statistical testing tools to test hypotheses, evaluate the findings and arguments (e.g. strength of relationships between variables) and make statistical observations under uncertainty.

    a.  Correlation test:

        -   Correlation web plot, or

        -   Significant Test of Correlation: ggscatterstats()

    b.  Model Diagnostic: checking for multicollinearity

    c.  Model Diagnostic: checking normality assumption

    d.  Oneway ANOVA Test: ggbetweenstats() method

# Prototype Sketches

The following sketches were drawn to conceptualise our thoughts and discussions on the layout of the Shiny app along with its various functions. 

These will subsequently be refined as we further codify and render our graphs and application. 

The various sections of our app consists of:- 

1.  **Landing page** - to visually summarise the impact of Global Terrorism incidents till date 

2.  **Global trends**- to examine the trends over time and deep dive into the nature of events 

3.  **Country statistics** - to enable users to deep dive into individual countries or regions to understand the impact of Terrorism in that locality 

4.  **Distribution analysis** - to examine the Distribution of Terror events against categorical variable like nature of targets, weapons used and types of attacks 

5.  **Confirmatory Analysis** - to visualise and examine/ test for relationships, associations and correlations etc 

::: panel-tabset
## Landing Page

This tab will serve as a “landing page” to inform and summarise the global impact till date. 

Proposed key features on the page include: 

-   World map to identify the countries/regions most impacted and location of events, based on different colour intensity, with the use of Latitude/ Longitude variables. 

-   Interactivity elements will be implemented with the tooltip information such as Country, Total Counts on Attack/ Killed/ Wounded etc.

## Global Trends

This tab will serve as the dashboard in the R Shiny application that will identify the most affected countries, groups with most attacks, types of weapons used, forms of attacks etc. 

Proposed key features on the page include: 

-   Interactive or Animated Bubble plot that shows the most affected countries over time, with the use of time slider or play button for animated graph. 

-   Line chart to plot how the number of attacks, casualties, wounded have changed over time, with the use of time slider or play button for animated graph. 

-   Bar chart to show the top terror groups. 

-   Word cloud to visualise the motives behind the attacks. 

-   World map to show the changes in terrorism “hotspots” over time. 

-   Interactivity elements will be implemented with the tooltip information such as Country, Counts on Total Attack/ Total Killed/ Total Wounded etc.

## Country Statistics

This tab will serve as a continuation from the ‘Global Trends’ tab.  

Proposed key features on the page include: 

-   World map, line/ bar chart and word cloud will show the details at regional level. 

-   Users will be able to select from the dropdown list for the country/ region that they would want to examine in more detail.

## Distribution

This tab will display the distribution of Terror events based on the different categorical variables such as Target/ Weapon/ Attack/ Region etc. 

Proposed key features on the page include: 

-   Bar charts and ridge density plots to show the distribution of the terror events based on the different variables. 

![](images/clipboard-2444559577.png)

## Confirmatory

This tab will examine and visualise the relationships, associations and correlations of different variables. 

Proposed key features on the page include: 

-   Association tests between categorical variables eg: ‘Modus operandi’ Vs Targets types. 

-   Time series seasonality test to examine if there is any seasonal element in attacks. 

-   Statistical test plots such as tests of correlation, multicollinearity, normality testing, etc.

# R Packages

Our team intends to use the following R packages to run the R Shiny Application:

-   *tidyverse*: a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.

-   *knitr*: an report generation tool.

-   *dplyr*: an R tool for working with data frame (e.g. objects).

-   *ggstatsplot*: an extension of ggplot2 package for statistical visualisation and graphics creation.

-   *ggdist*: an R package that support visualisation of distribution and uncertainty.

-   *ggiraph:* for making ‘ggplot’ graphics interactive.

-   *plotly:* R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.

-   *performance*: an R package used for assessment, comparison and testing of statistical models.

-   *parameters*: an R package used for processing parameters of various statistical models.

-   *RColorBrewer*: an R package that provide various colour schemes and colour palettes.

-   *DT*: an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables that create interactive table on html page.
