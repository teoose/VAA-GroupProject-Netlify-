A good visual analysis of terrorist attacks is essential to help (1) discover global terrorism trends, (2) unveil hidden relationships among terrorist networks through their attacks and (3) ascertain the impact of fatalities and losses.\nThe team aims to use open-source data which includes information on terrorist events globally to provide easy-to-use and insightful visualisation tools that can be especially suitable for Defence and Security sectors to develop effective counter terrorism measures and strategies.\n\n\nObjectives\nThe objective of this project is to:\n\nExamine open-source data on terrorist events worldwide (The Global Terrorism Database(GTD)) and derive useful insights on the factors and conditions that may affect international terrorist incidents, and\nBuild a web-enabled interactive visual analytics application by using R Shiny based on this Global Terrorism Database (GTD).\n\n\n\nData\nThe project will examine the Global Terrorism Database™ (GTD) from University of Maryland that holds 5 decades (i.e. Year 1970 to Year 2020) of attack events that happened in 203 countries. The original dataset consists of 209,706 observations and 135 variables. Given the large dataset, the team will filter the dataset to eliminate unnecessary data to ensure quality of data used is pertinent to project objective.\n\n\nMethodology & Analytical Approach\nFor this project, the following approach will be taken by the team:\n\nData Preparation: Clean the dataset by removing irrelevant variables, filtering variables and encoding categorical variables if necessary.\n\nThe table below shows the variables that we have selected to maintain.\nFor detailed description of the variables, please refer to the Code Book in the reference section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis via Data Visualisation Methods: Analyse the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identify patterns, and explore correlation between variables. Such as using:\n\nTime-series bar/ line chart and bubble plot\nGeospatial heatmaps and hotspot maps\n\nConfirmatory Data Analysis via Statistical Methods: Analyse the dataset using statistical testing tools to test hypotheses, evaluate the findings and arguments (e.g. strength of relationships between variables) and make statistical observations under uncertainty.\n\nCorrelation test:\n\nCorrelation web plot, or\nSignificant Test of Correlation: ggscatterstats()\n\nModel Diagnostic: checking for multicollinearity\nModel Diagnostic: checking normality assumption\nOneway ANOVA Test: ggbetweenstats() method\n\n\n\n\nPrototype Sketches\nThe following sketches were drawn to conceptualise our thoughts and discussions on the layout of the Shiny app along with its various functions. \nThese will subsequently be refined as we further codify and render our graphs and application. \nThe various sections of our app consists of:- \n\nLanding page - to visually summarise the impact of Global Terrorism incidents till date \nGlobal trends- to examine the trends over time and deep dive into the nature of events \nCountry statistics - to enable users to deep dive into individual countries or regions to understand the impact of Terrorism in that locality \nDistribution analysis - to examine the Distribution of Terror events against categorical variable like nature of targets, weapons used and types of attacks \nConfirmatory Analysis - to visualise and examine/ test for relationships, associations and correlations etc \n\n\nLanding PageGlobal TrendsCountry StatisticsDistributionConfirmatory\n\n\nThis tab will serve as a “landing page” to inform and summarise the global impact till date. \nProposed key features on the page include: \n\nWorld map to identify the countries/regions most impacted and location of events, based on different colour intensity, with the use of Latitude/ Longitude variables. \nInteractivity elements will be implemented with the tooltip information such as Country, Total Counts on Attack/ Killed/ Wounded etc. \n\n\n\n\nThis tab will serve as the dashboard in the R Shiny application that will identify the most affected countries, groups with most attacks, types of weapons used, forms of attacks etc. \nProposed key features on the page include: \n\nInteractive or Animated Bubble plot that shows the most affected countries over time, with the use of time slider or play button for animated graph. \nLine chart to plot how the number of attacks, casualties, wounded have changed over time, with the use of time slider or play button for animated graph. \nBar chart to show the top terror groups. \nWord cloud to visualise the motives behind the attacks. \nWorld map to show the changes in terrorism “hotspots” over time. \nInteractivity elements will be implemented with the tooltip information such as Country, Counts on Total Attack/ Total Killed/ Total Wounded etc. \n\n\n\n\nThis tab will serve as a continuation from the ‘Global Trends’ tab.  \nProposed key features on the page include: \n\nWorld map, line/ bar chart and word cloud will show the details at regional level. \nUsers will be able to select from the dropdown list for the country/ region that they would want to examine in more detail. \n\n\n\n\nThis tab will display the distribution of Terror events based on the different categorical variables such as Target/ Weapon/ Attack/ Region etc. \nProposed key features on the page include: \n\nBar charts and ridge density plots to show the distribution of the terror events based on the different variables. \n\n\n\n\nThis tab will examine and visualise the relationships, associations and correlations of different variables. \nProposed key features on the page include: \n\nAssociation tests between categorical variables eg: ‘Modus operandi’ Vs Targets types. \nTime series seasonality test to examine if there is any seasonal element in attacks. \nStatistical test plots such as tests of correlation, multicollinearity, normality testing, etc. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Packages\nOur team intends to use the following R packages to run the R Shiny Application:\n\ntidyverse: a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\nknitr: an report generation tool.\ndplyr: an R tool for working with data frame (e.g. objects).\nggstatsplot: an extension of ggplot2 package for statistical visualisation and graphics creation.\nggdist: an R package that support visualisation of distribution and uncertainty.\nggiraph: for making ‘ggplot’ graphics interactive.\nplotly: R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\nperformance: an R package used for assessment, comparison and testing of statistical models.\nparameters: an R package used for processing parameters of various statistical models.\nRColorBrewer: an R package that provide various colour schemes and colour palettes.\nDT: an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables that create interactive table on html page.\n\n\n\nProject Schedule\nBelow is an overview of our project timeline.

According to International Crisis Group, there was a fresh wave of major combats in the recent years whereby one of the conflict (which was close to our nation - Singapore) was prompted by Myanmar army’s 2021 power grab. The International Crisis Group has listed Myanmar (one of the countries in South-East Asia) as the top 10 conflicts to watch in 2024. This threatens the public at both physical and psychological levels, and raised concerns among the Defence and Security sectors on the urgency to develop effective counter terrorism measures and strategies.\nThe team aims to use open-source data from armed conflict events (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED)) to provide easy-to-use and insightful visualisation tools that can be especially suitable to help (1) discover armed conflicts trends and (2) conceptualise armed conflict spaces.\n\n\n\nObjectives\nThe objective of this project is to:\n\nExamine open-source data on armed conflict incidents (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED)) and derive useful insights on the factors and conditions that may affect armed conflict incidents,\nConceptualise armed conflict spaces in Myanmar, and\nBuild a web-enabled interactive visual analytics application by using R Shiny based on the dataset.\n\n\n\nData\nThe project will examine the dataset from Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), specifically Myanmar country, between Year 2010 and Year 2023.

    "text": "ISSS608 Group 5 Meeting Minutes\nProject Meeting 2: Project Netlify, R Shiny dashboard modules, Data preparation\nDate: 09/03/2024 Time: 10.30am – 12.15pm\nIn Attendance Imran Bin Mohd Ibrahim, Teo Suan Ern\nAbsent Wong Ngai Munn Zachary Mark\nAgenda Items 1. Finalise project topic 2. Discussion on Netlify pages 3. Updates on R Shiny dashboard modules • Exploratory (Data Analysis & Geospatial Data Analysis) • Geospatial Analysis (“Cluster and Outlier Analysis” & “Hot and Zone Spot Analysis”) 4. Discussion on data preparation (included geospatial) 5. Any Other Matters/ Follow-up Action\nAgenda Item 1: Finalise project topic\n\nFinalise project topic Following from the consultation with Prof Kam on 24 February 2024, the team has decided to follow Prof Kam’s advice to adopt the alternative dataset from ACLED and focus on Myanmar instead of Global Terrorism Database from University of Maryland. The ACLED dataset looks at armed conflict incidents as it has more potential.\n\nGiven the changes in the project topic, Imran suggested that the team could have a revised version of the project proposal. Suan Ern agreed with Imran’s suggestion and will follow-up to work on revising the project proposal page (version 2).\nEach team member will take one of the main prototype modules as follows: • Exploratory Data Analysis (Initial & Geospatial) – Suan Ern • “Cluster and Outlier Analysis” & “Hot and Zone Spot Analysis” – Imran • Confirmatory Data Analysis – Zachary\nAgenda Item 2: Discussion on Netlify pages\n\nDiscussion on Main and Prototype page Suan Ern suggested that the team should consider working on the Shiny application and Netlify (Quarto) pages concurrently. Imran thought that it would be good as certain information (pages) could be easily populated (such as Prototype page can be derived from individual members’ take-home exercise 4 and segments from project proposal could be used to fill some of the content on the main page). Imran agreed to be the main POC for Shiny application (in terms of combining all modules done by all team members) while Suan Ern will follow-up to work on incorporating the few Netlify pages discussed.\n\nAgenda Item 3: Updates on R Shiny dashboard modules\n\nDiscussion on Exploratory Suan Ern updated on the Exploratory tab in Shiny application. She mentioned that she has saved the cleaned dataset after her data preparation in .rds format for Shiny application. o Overview Suan Ern shared that the subtab would serve as the “landing page” that will display an overview of Myanmar map with its spatial points of armed conflicts over the years (i.e. 2010 to 2023). She added that the spatial points are categorised into different colours by event type category.\n\nImran agreed that the landing page can be an overview of a Myanmar map and suggested to have a datatable as well. Suan Ern highlighted her concerns in terms of the loading speed of main Shiny page. The team agreed that they would reconsider the layout again after incorporating all Shiny modules for the project and determine the capacity load.\no Geospatial exploration Suan Ern showed the two geospatial exploration maps (i.e. statistical distribution and spatial distribution) under the Geospatial exploration tab. She shared that the different choropleth maps have different display variables and allow users to perform spatial exploration to conceptualise armed conflict spaces in Myanmar using its own filtering parameters. Suan Ern explained that the boxmap is a spatial representation that is like boxplot and histogram, which is useful to detect outliers and visualise distribution of variables.\nImran suggested to label the filtering parameters according to the different maps to provide greater clarity to users. Suan Ern explained that she has included a text liner to describe the filter options’ applicability to the specific map.\no Trends Suan Ern explained that the tab will perform time series analysis to identify trends, or cyclic patterns, spot anomalies, visualise distribution of armed conflict incidents/ fatalities and how it has changed over the years using either line chart or calendar heatmap. She shared that she has separated the two charts in different rows (with collapsible feature) to allow users to hide the line chart if users are only keen to display calendar heatmap.\no Distribution For the distribution tab, Suan Ern shared that it would provide users with data exploration tools to explore the distribution of armed conflict incidents that resulted in fatalities and the dispersion of such incidents across the years in Myanmar. However, she highlighted her concerns in terms of the speed of loading the two charts. She has included a page loading animation indicator bar on all her charts so as to ‘inform’ users that the charts are loading instead of a blank page.\nImran mentioned that it is a good idea to have the page loading animation indicator bar as our project dataset is large.\no Network relationships For the network relationships tab, Suan Ern presented the network graph that would allow users to explore on the network association amongst the top actors (with more than 300 interactions with the other actors in each year) involved in the armed conflict incidents in Myanmar.\no Incident Summary Suan Ern presented the final tab that she has created, which would visualise large volume of armed conflict incident summary notes that captures keywords recorded in a word cloud. This would be useful to spot changes over time where users do not have to read through all incident summary notes. The tab will also include a data table of the entire dataset.\nImran shared that he has also considered similar concept of having a plot and the data table next to it (which he would share further in his Shiny application).\n\nDiscussion on Geospatial Analysis Imran mentioned that he has saved the cleaned dataset after his data preparation in .csv format for Shiny application. Imran explained that his prototype has two main tabs (‘cluster and outlier analysis’ & ‘Hot and cold zone analysis’). For ‘cluster and outlier analysis’ tab, he has further split them into three different sub-tabs to cover the different forms of geospatial analysis.\n\no Cluster and Outlier Analysis – first sub-tab Imran presented the first tab with a proportional symbol map and a choropleth map that he has created to provide users with a visual introduction of the state of armed conflict incidents in Myanmar. On the functionality and interactivity components, Imran added that the Proportional Symbol Map would allow users to select the specific year and event type, where users will be able to see where conflicts events have happened in the country across. Furthermore, the size of the symbols will correspond to the number of fatalities.\nThe choropleth map visualises the “intensity” of event types through use of color gradient. Instead of implementing a global filter to filter and affect both plots, Imran explained that he has chosen to apply separate filter selections for each plot to enable users to explore different data independently.\nSuan Ern realised the similarities of the two maps on exploratory tab - overview and geospatial exploration sub-tab pages, and clarified with Imran on the filter components for choropleth maps. She highlighted that the choropleth maps may use different filter options (such as adjusting the different ‘kernel’ options).\nImran explained that his choropleth map used frequency counts while Suan Ern’s spatial distribution map used frequency rate, he suggested to implement the best practice of each team member when he consolidates the Shiny codes to ensure that each map serves its unique purpose.\no Cluster and outlier analysis – second sub-tab Imran shared that this tab has two choropleth maps rendering the Local Moran’s I statistics and its corresponding p-values as well as a data table of the statistics. He went on to explain that users will be able to select the year and the event type once. Both maps, along with the data table will be updated upon user selection.\no Cluster and outlier analysis – third sub-tab Imran shared that this would provide users with a visualisation of statistically significant clusters via the LISA Maps which would help users understand how clusters of event types may have developed and/or changed over time by adjusting the filters options.\nHe further added that the Moran scatterplot enables users to see the statistically significant region names, by means of the quadrants and the annotations, whereas, Lisa Cluster map shows the specific parts of the country which are categorised as statistically significant or insignificant.\nSuan Ern clarified the filters options below Local Moran’s I Statistic, but there was none for Local Moran’s I P values map. Imran explained that he intended to have a global filter that would update both maps as well as the data table.\no Hot and cold zone analysis Imran shared that this module provides users with a visualisation of statistically significant areas of event types, using the Getis and Ord’s G statistics in order to help users understand how hot and cold zones may have developed and/or changed over time.\nBoth the map and the data table will be updated upon user selection of year and event type. For the choropleth map, users will be able to select the specific year, event type, the data classification method and the number of clusters for the adaptive weight matrix. In addition, a data table that shows the statistics being rendered in the map can serve as a reference to users for the results filtered from user selection.\n\nDiscussion on Shiny template Suan Ern shared that she managed to figure out customising the colour themes in Shiny and has adjusted the colours for navigation bar (a darker tone colour of red) and side bar (light grey and hover-over to match the overall navigation bar colour). She also shared that she has tried to standardise the filter box colour to a different colour from the main box panel for plots to allow users to easily differentiate the different layout features. Suan Ern further added that she also tried to standardised her layout to either the extreme left or right panels for a consistency look and user as part of user experience. Imran mentioned that for consistency of the dashboard, it would be good to standardise the format and would use Suan Ern’s format when incorporating his prototype’s filter components.\n\nImran raised his concerns in compiling the R Shiny application code for the team, as careful consideration is needed to consider which plots should be grouped together on the same tab/page. He further added that his R Shiny application code’s reactive statements grew in length and complexity, and errors were hard to isolate and easily propagated to other functions and outputs. Imran shared that he has adopted a modular approach (unique UI-Server code pairing) and allowed him to have easier trouble shooting (isolate errors per individual plot’s code chunk). Suan Ern agreed and mentioned that she also did the same and grouped the codes in the same ‘module’ by utilitising comment line.\nAgenda Item 3: Discussion on data preparation (included geospatial) 1. Discussion on data preparation and new variables created Suan Ern explained that she has done two different data preparation, (1) data preparation for non-geospatial related plots and (2) data preparation for geospatial plots.\nFor (1), Suan Ern shared that she has tried to check the data structure of the dataset and found that the event date variable was in character format. Hence, she has converted that variable to string format. She has also tried to create some variables based on total armed conflict incidents and total fatalities (by disorder type and sub event type), such as annual percentage of political violence/ annual percentage of violence against civilian and extracted day/ month from the event date variable, for subsequent data exploration.\n\nDiscussion on geospatial data preparation/ geospatial boundary Imran shared his data preparation from his take-home exercise 4, where he tried to use admin 1 (region/state) and admin 2 (districts) levels. However, for most of his plots, he mentioned that he was using admin 2 levels.\n\nImran used the shape files from the Myanmmar Information Management Unit (MIMU) website, as he found that GADM and GeoBoundaries have their limitations in terms of the administrative region information and map levels, where he tried to check for unique district names from the shape files (admin level 2) by identifying discrepancies and re-named some administrative areas (such as from Yangon-East changed to Yangon (East)) to synchronise with the downloaded shape files from MIMU.\nFor geospatial data preparation, Suan Ern explained that she used the cleaned dataset that she extracted from data preparation segment. She explained that she downloaded all three levels of Myanmar administrative boundaries from geoBoundaries but only used Myanmar Level-2 Administrative Boundary in the subsequent geospatial exploration where she used EPSG:4979 - WGS 84 Geographic Coordinate system and EPSG:4144 - Myanmar Projected Coordinate System.\nImran highlighted that given that each member did different geospatial data preparation methods, he suggested to look into it and would update the team on the final dataset for Shiny application.\nAgenda Item 4: Any Other Matters/ Follow-up Action\nWith no other matters, the meeting ended at 12:15pm.\nFollow-up Actions: o The team updated Zachary via Telegram group chat on the team’s meeting and progress. o Suan Ern will prepare the draft minutes of meeting and update the team for inputs. o The team agreed to meet every week for the subsequent weeks (every Saturday, 10.30am) till project submission. o The team agreed on the follow-up actions for the next meeting: Zachary • Complete confirmatory analysis Shiny prototype\nImran • Test and implement interactivity portion for static plots in his Shiny prototype • Merge team members Shiny prototypes\nSuan Ern • Test and link filters components in her Shiny prototype • Revise project proposal (with ACLED dataset) • Combine team members Quarto documents as Prototype page in Netlify.\n\n\n\n Back to top"
